I asked ChatGPT to help me to spot where the deadlock is

one of the major conceptual difficulties was ensuring proper synchronization and consistency when handling concurrent shard additions and removals. Specifically, managing access to shared resources, such as the shards map, required careful use of locks to avoid race conditions while also ensuring that shard copying was fully completed before the shard was marked as active. Debugging these concurrency issues proved challenging, as any improper synchronization could lead to race condition. Balancing concurrency and correctness while maintaining clear, efficient logic in the code posed significant challenges.
