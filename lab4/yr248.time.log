In this lab, I applied the lessons learned from my previous project, where starting late limited my comprehension. This time, I began early and dedicated more focus to grasp every concept thoroughly. The project reinforced my understanding of Go's concurrency model and server-side programming, building on my foundational knowledge from previous labs. I gained practical experience in implementing thread-safe data structures, handling sharding and replication, and managing failovers and error handling. This hands-on work improved my problem-solving skills and deepened my confidence in building robust distributed systems. Overall, this lab was an invaluable exercise in developing resilient and scalable key-value storage solutions.
